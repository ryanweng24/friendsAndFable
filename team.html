                            MESSAGE FROM THE FOUNDER
                        </h4>
                        <p class="raleway">
                            Friends & Fable started because of my personal desire to do one simple thing: to connect the dance community that I have grown to love.
                        </p>
                        <p class="raleway">
                            It was in San Diego where I first got introduced to the dance community as I know it today. While it was a new and scary experience at first, the welcoming and friendly culture helped me feel safe to step outside of my comfort zone and learn to express myself. I grew to love the movement and soon dancing became a very intimate subject for me. For me, dancing wasn't just about the exercise or some past time activity I did for fun; my greatest life lessons, personal growth, and friendships were made because of my involvement within the community. I can now proudly say that being a "dancer" is part of who I am today. In my short time in San Diego, I have had many opportunities to be involved in different dance affairs. From taking part in a few collegiate teams, to learning and teaching choreography; from dancing in projects alongside extremely talented peers, to helping run a full scale hip hop show... the list goes on. This experience thus far has been, for a lack of better words, life changing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="raleway">
                            Above all, the one thing that has never failed to blow my mind is the people that I've had the pleasure of meeting along the way. They have insanely inspiring unique ideas and visions stemming from their experience in dancing. From outreach efforts to unite different communities to putting on benefit concerts to motivate people to follow their dreams... these folks are crazy! You'd seriously think that they were superhuman with the amount of heart they put into what they do. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="raleway">
                            Their adventures and stories they continue to share are the motivations behind Friends & Fable because they inspire me to want to be a part of the creative process. I just kept telling myself that I would love nothing than to be involved in their project and see their goal through them. And that's the magic! I truly believe when the right people meet other right people at the right time, great things are bound to happen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="raleway">
                            My purpose in starting this website is not to try and turn a profit, to compete with other dance blogs, or to gain personal publicity. It is my desire to share the projects that really matter and have an underlying goal to see the dance community grow. Thank you for taking the time to read this message, it is my sincerest hope that you will find something here to take away with you so you can also start your own project. If you find that you may need a helping hand or just want to talk, I invite you to reach out to us here at F&F!

                                            Tracy is a UC San Diego grad with a crazy passion for making ideas happen and an advocate for all things that encourage creativity. When she’s not at studios and workshops dancing the late nights away, she enjoys going on many food adventures (instagramming it all along the way), binge-watching an unhealthy amount of netflix and being sarcastic, kinda.

                                            A: It would definitely have to be the ability to find anything in the world - nothing is more frustrating than to lose something that you need (which happens to me way too often).

                                            A: Any housing kind of combinations! I may not be that great at housing, but I love the continual movement and flow.

                                            A: I wish I was good at public speaking...I think anybody who has the ability to speak their thoughts coherently and effectively can really be a big influence. It's my hope one day that I can be an effective public speaker (just got to get over the stage fright)!
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A: I don't really have a solid "dream" per se, I just want to be happy. I think the definition of being "happy" changes at any given point in a person's life. I strive everyday to live in the moment and really remind myself if what I am doing at that point in time is making me happy. I challenge everybody to practice mindfulness and to not let life pass you by; own every second that this world could give.

                                            A: If I could have any superpower, it'd be awesome to have a combo of telepathy and telekinesis so I could move things with my mind. Also, telepathy would be extremely helpful for awkward situations and/or conflict management. What up for improving communication skills by better understanding where others are coming from.

                                            A: My favorite dance move would have to be some sort of graceful melt into a hit because I love that change of dynamic and element of surprise of being all loose and graceful into a sharp hard move or freeze.

                                            A: Outside of F&F I enjoy eating delicious foods from near and far, snowboarding, volunteering in the community, and am currently working on improving my bouldering and yoga technique. Whoo for trying new things!

                                            A: If I could be a pro at anything, I'd love to be a professional ballerina (cheesy, I know), but as a little girl I grew up doing ballet and was beginning my pointe classes but had to quit in high school. I was never able to get back into it, but the art is so beautiful and I've always wondered what it would be like to be the leading role as the Sugar Plum Fairy in a famous ballet show.

If I could fly, I wouldn’t have to worry about any of that because I could just fly to where I need to go. I just hope flying wouldn’t make me tired… I’d want to fly like how super heroes do? You know.. Power-assisted. Not like.. I have wings and I need to flap them myself to get myself up and out.

                                            A: It sounds cliché, but my dream is to live with no regrets (no ragrets lol). Above all else though when it’s all said and done, I want to leave the world with a positive impact. I don’t necessarily need to be recognized for it or anything but going out with a (good) bang is what I want more than anything.

He also really loves showers... they make any day better.

                                            A: I would wanna be pro at logical reasoning or deduction since I really enjoy mystery thrillers and stuff like Sherlock Holmes. It'd be pretty cool to be able to think at that level. Also I love riddles, so that'd be quite helpful.

                                            A: I dream about dreaming... no, but seriously I rarely rememeber my dreams when I sleep, so I think remembering my dreams would be nice since it's said to offer insight into your subconscious. Sometimes I daydream to make up for it.

                                            A: I would choose telekinesis because this great superpower comes with a creative mind.

He’s got a hell of a sweet tooth, and dreams of learning to fly...if he ever gets over his fear of heights.

                                            A: I would totally rock a teleportation power. Mostly because it would make my life so much easier, and save so much time. Instead of running around trying to adjust lights here, there, and everywhere, I could just “jump” to each one, adjust them, and return to where I was in the first place! Soooooo much easier.

                                            A: In general, besides cinematography, I also like just some casual photography. But my biggest hobby definitely has to be gaming. Any kind of gaming. FPS, RPG, MMO, you name it. I also like general arts and crafts, just throwing together with a little bit of glue and string.

                                            A: Heh. I would be a pro at cinematography. Not only is it my career, it is my hobby, my love, and my main interest. However, to me, being a “pro” just means that I have mastered the basics. I never tire of learning more, and there is always someone better than me to learn from.

I could literally be anyone I wanted to be and gain a broader perspective by walking a mile in their shoes. I could be famous, or I could blend in with locals in a foreign country. As a short person, I could see if the air really is fresher at 6ft. The possiblities are endless!
